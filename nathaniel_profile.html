    <h1 id ="header" style="text-align: center; background-color:black;">Welcome to Nathaniel Ngo's Profile Page</h1>
    <p>Hello and welcome to my profile page. By visiting this page, I hope you learn something new about me.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2 id ="header2" style="text-align:center;">Bio/About me</h2>
    <p>I was born in Peoria, Illinois on November 30, 1999 and am currently
         majoring in computer information systems (CIS) at Bradley University.
          Some of my interests include video games, film/TV shows, and music.
    </p>

    <h2 id ="header3" style="text-align:center;">Video Games</h2>
    <p>The first game I played was Need For Speed 2 when I was only 4 years old.
         Since then I have played hundreds of games across many systems/platforms. I currently
          play video games on a gaming PC. I may buy a PS5 in the future but not 100% yet.
          Some of my favorite video games/video game franchises are:
          <ul>
              <li>Monster Hunter: World</li>
              <li>Call of Duty: Black Ops</li>
              <li>The Yakuza series</li>
              <li>Hades</li>
              <li>Apex Legends</li>
              <li>Dark Souls III</li>
              <li>Cyberpunk 2077</li>
              <li>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth</li>
          </ul>
          Video games are a fun subject because you can enjoy them for a
           variety of different reasons, whether it be the gameplay itself, the story,
            the (if present) multiplayer mode, the graphics/artstyle, the soundtrack, or
             any combination of those reasons.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id ="header4" style="text-align:center;">Film</h2>
    <p>I had always enjoyed movies since I was a kid, but when I was around 12 I 
         began to watch movies more frequently. There are many movies I saw
          around that age that I want to rewatch since it has been almost a decade
           since I saw them. 
    </p>
    <p>Just like video games, there are many reasons to enjoy a movie, but for me, I
         mostly like watching them for the story. I also enjoy action movies a lot. Some of my favorite
         movies are:
         <ul>
             <li style ="font: italic;">Blade Runner 2049</li>
             <li style ="font: italic;">Thoroughbreds</li>
             <li style ="font: italic;">Knives Out</li>
             <li style ="font: italic;">Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</li>
             <li style ="font: italic;">The Departed</li>
             <li style ="font: italic;">The Raid</li>
         </ul>
         
    </p>

    <h2 id ="header5" style="text-align:center;">TV</h2>
    <p>TV was never really my thing until around when I was 14, which 
        is when I got Netflix. Sometimes I like TV shows more than movies
         because shows are longer, which means there is much more room for 
          character development. Some of my favorite shows are:
          <ul>
              <li>The Wire</li>
              <li>Mr. Robot</li>
              <li>Dark</li>
              <li>One Piece (this is an anime but I think it is still a show)</li>
          </ul>
    </p>

    <h2 id ="header6" style="text-align:center;">Music</h2>
    <p>I did not listen to much music growing up, and when I was about 11 or 12 I 
        got an iPod Touch and started to try finding music I liked. I listened to a lot of
         dubstep/electronic music until I was 14, at which point I started to listen
          to a lot of rap music. My taste was basically those two genres until I was 19,
           where I started listening to a lot of pop/electronic pop as well. I tend to enjoy the production
            of the song more than the lyrics themselves, but obviously I don't mind
             if the lyrics are amazing as well. Some of my favorite albums/projects are:
             <ul>
                 <li>Better Off Dead by Flatbush Zombies</li>
                 <li>Unknown Memory by Yung Lean</li>
                 <li>Pop 2 by Charli XCX</li>
                 <li>TA13OO by Denzel Curry</li>
                 <li>Recess by Skrillex</li>
             </ul>

    </p>
